# Build/Run Instructions

## Build Instructions
To build the website based on the given specifications, you will need to create the necessary HTML files and organize them in a directory structure. Here are the step-by-step instructions to build the website:

Create a new directory for your project. Let's call it "website" for this example.

Inside the "website" directory, create the following HTML files:

index.html: This will be the landing page of the application. Add the required elements such as a banner, navigation bar, main content section, and footer.

login.html: This page will be used for user login. Include a document title, section heading introducing the login form, a navigation bar, form fields for username and password, and a submit button.

registration.html: This page is for guest registration. Include a document title, section heading introducing the registration form, a navigation bar, form fields for username, email, password, confirm password, age acceptance, terms of service acceptance, and a submit button.

postvideo.html: This page is for registered users to post videos. Include a document title, section heading introducing the video posting form, a navigation bar, form fields for post title, post description, video upload, acceptable use policy acceptance, and a submit button.

viewpost.html: This page is for viewing/watching an individual video post. Include a navigation bar, tags for post title, post author, post creation time, video display, and a comment section.
## Run Instructions
To run the website locally, you can follow these steps:

Make sure you have a web browser installed on your computer.

Open the terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your website files are located. For example, if your website files are in a directory named "website," you can navigate to it by using the cd command.

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/website
Once you are in the correct directory, you can start a local web server to serve the files. There are several ways to do this
